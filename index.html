        <p>My favourite hobby is riding cycle. Bicycle is one of the best vehicles in the replace for its various aspects. The bicycle is made of two wheels, which consisting two tiers and tubes an iron frame.
            <br> <br> <br>
            It has a paddle, handle, and brake to increase and decrease its speed. It has a seat cover and seat on which a rider sits and drives it. Cycling is mainly an aerobic activity, which means that your heart, blood vessels and lungs all get a workout. You will breathe deeper, perspire and experience increased body temperature, which will improve your overall fitness level. The health benefits of regular cycling include: increased cardiovascular fitness. Bicycling has been a long-time hobby which produces both long and short-term benefits.
            <br> <br> <br>
            It’s an enjoyable activity which involves being outdoors and away from the less beneficial pursuits such as television, computer and the refrigerator. It’s a vigorous interest that not just the young and healthy can participate but kids as young as toddlers and the elderly as well. In addition, provided they have the proper equipment, disabled person can too. Cycling fits into a person’s lifestyle easier than many other physical activities because it can be used practically, to go from one place to another unlike, say, swimming which is fun but much more limited by the time of year and availability. It’s easier on the body’s joints than jogging while getting from point “A” to point “B” much quicker and with less effort. Chief among its numerous benefits, cycling is good for health, both physical and mental as well as good for the environment.
            <br> <br> <br>
            One of the main health benefits of cycling is that it strengthens the heart, develops endurance and improves circulation which reduces the risks from coronary heart illnesses, one of the major causes of death. Gaining endurance also lowers the chances of contracting some types of cancers and diabetes. Muscles are strengthened and toned from cycling particularly those located below the waistline such as the thighs, buttocks and legs. Many of those who have weakened or injured joints and cannot run to stay in shape turn to cycling to help keep them active because it is a lower impact exercise. Maintaining a proper body weight is not just good for the ego but benefits health in several, well documented ways. A cyclist burns a great deal of calories especially if they are riding a good distance or at a moderate to fast pace.
